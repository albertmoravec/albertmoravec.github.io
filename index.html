<p>This post is gonna be a little flashback for me, as I started working on this project before I created this blog, so if I miss anything you&rsquo;d like to know, don&rsquo;t hesitate to tell me in the comments. It should serve more as a build log where I can release assets I created to the public and maybe help a few people with creating their own components, not necessarily for Eagle.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-data">Getting the data</h2>

<p>Before I really started creating the library and drawing the PCB I had to do a bit of research, so I know the dimensions, common sizing, proper parts alignment etc. Getting Cherry MX switch dimensions may be bit of a pain in the ass, because it&rsquo;s all in inches instead of millimeters (<em>and we don&rsquo;t want that</em>). However as I continued digging around I found out there&rsquo;s an older Cherry MX datasheet containing the same dimensions, but in millimeters, the only valid unit on planet Earth! It&rsquo;s not that hard to find out where to get it, but one of the goals of this blog is to archive stuff I might need in the future, so I&rsquo;ll post it anyway. But enough talking, you can download the datasheet <a href="/files/cherry-mx-datasheet.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>This beautiful piece of art contains <em>almost</em> everything to create Cherry compatible PCB, it even has stabilizer dimensions for various sizes, but sadly it does not for the most important one - <strong>6.25u spacebar stabilizer</strong> - but no worries, by poking around and measuring other boards I found out the &ldquo;A&rdquo; dimension in the datasheet for 6.25u keycap is <strong>100mm</strong>. Now that&rsquo;s everything I needed to create Cherry MX library for Eagle.</p>

<h3 id="note-units">Note: units</h3>

<p>Before going through the drawing part I&rsquo;d like to point out an important thing to remember. Keycap sizes are measured in units, but they won&rsquo;t tell you much about the actual size, so it&rsquo;s important to remember that <strong>1u is 19.05mm</strong>. It is mentioned in the datasheet too, but most of the calculations you&rsquo;re gonna do to figure out the keycap footprint will use this number, that&rsquo;s why this number is super important. It also contains the margin needed between individual switches/keycaps, so you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it. Now we can jump to the drawing itself&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="drawing-the-easy-part-or-not">Drawing - the easy part (or not?)</h2>

<p>As my board is meant for plate mount switches with THT LEDs, I used the following drawing to create basic 1u switch component:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="/media/cherry-library/switch-drawing.png" alt="Cherry MX switch footprint" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <p>
        Cherry MX switch footprint
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>From now on it may look pretty straightforward, place switch and LED pads, fixation pin holes acording to the datasheet and you&rsquo;re done. However using a component like this would be quite painful, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="/media/cherry-library/switch-plain.png" alt="Switch without outline" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <p>
        Switch without outline
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>This way it&rsquo;s quite&hellip; empty. To make it usuable it&rsquo;s missing a few important things, most importantly footprint of the switch itself and then it should also contain the keycap dimension (that means its unit size) so I can easily align them on the board to match the desired layout. So the next thing I did was drawing 15.6x15.6mm square which represents the switch, but that still isn&rsquo;t enough for convenient work&hellip; even though I can imagine someone using it with correct grid settings. The last step was drawing 19.05x19.05 square to represent the keycap (more precisely switch with the necessary margins). Here&rsquo;s the final result:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="/media/cherry-library/switch-complete.png" alt="Complete 1u component" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <p>

        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Mind that while this is really convenient for PCB drawing, those lines are going to get printed on the PCB silkscreen and might confuse the user, so I&rsquo;m probably going to put them into a different layer and I highly recommend doing the same to you if you plan on using this library for production before I change it myself.</p>

<p>Now I simply copied this footprint and created 1.5u and other sizes. Calculating the dashed line length for them is pretty easy as you just take the unit size and multiply it by 19.05. Be sure to have the switch in the component center!</p>

<h3 id="note-stepped-caps-lock">Note: stepped caps lock</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a little gotcha when it comes to the stepped caps lock. Due to the step the keycap itself is 1.75u, but the stem is usually placed in the center of the higher 1.25u wide part of the keycap, so you need to use 1.25u component for stepped caps lock support. This way the board should match majority of the caps lock keycaps.</p>


<figure >

        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<h2 id="bring-the-stabs">Bring the stabs</h2>

<p>Unfortunately copying works for keycaps smaller than 2u. When the key is equal or bigger than 2u, you have to care about stabilizers. So I had to peek into the datasheet once again. God bless Cherry for providing simple footprint drawing I could use.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="/media/cherry-library/stab-drawing.png" alt="Cherry stabilizer positions" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <p>

        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>I could safely copy the switch footprint itself (that means everything within the solid line in the 1u component), but to create 2u component I had to add 4 more mounting holes for stabilizers. Once it&rsquo;s done, it is pretty easy to derive the rest using the datasheet and the fact that &ldquo;A&rdquo; dimension for 6.25u is 100mm.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="/media/cherry-library/2u-stabs.png" alt="Complete 2u component" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <p>

        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>For those who went through the datasheet really carefully, you may noticed that there&rsquo;s no plate cutout drawing for 6u keycap. The reason is that the 6u keycap is <em>usually</em> off-centered, so I couldn&rsquo;t simply copy-paste it. Now I always want to have the origin point of the component in the switch center, so I had to pay attention to how I draw it to avoid misaligned switch. But the problem was that I couldn&rsquo;t find the 6u footprint anywhere, so I went to <a href="http://builder.swillkb.com/">Swillkb Plate Builder</a> and created a plate containing the desired 6u spcebar (by the way Swillkb plate builder is really helpful for various other dimension checks).</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="/media/cherry-library/6u-plate.png" alt="Plate with 6u key (notice the spacebar switch position)" />

        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>After opening the result in Autocad I was finally able to get the dimensions needed for the 6u component. Phew!</p>

        <img src="/media/cherry-library/6u-complete.png" alt="Complete 6u spacebar" />

    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<h2 id="iso-enter-masterrace">ISO Enter masterrace</h2>

<p>The only thing that was missing by now was the glorious ISO enter, the one and only. And I must admit that this one almost got me, because I fell for its trick also known as the <code>G AP</code>. ISO enter may seem to be a plain rotated 2u key with adjusted outline (that also means that you need stabilizers), but that&rsquo;s not true and actually doing that would end up in a <code>G AP</code> failure.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="/media/cherry-library/gap.png" alt="The G AP" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <p>

        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>I&rsquo;d say that the ISO enter key is completely unique, there&rsquo;s really nothing to be used as a copypasta template. In fact I used the 2u rotated component as a base, because it had the correct stabilizer spacing at least. However I still had to adjust the outline, because the ISO enter is 1.25 wide at the bottom and 2u wide at the top. To calculate the correct dimensions it&rsquo;s really important to work with the 19.05mm value. Each side of the cap is completely different, so I had to fight with the calculator a bit to get precise results, but I finally ended up with this masterpiece:</p>

<p>Eh, what a wall of text I made. I truly hope that it didn&rsquo;t scare you off and helped you to understand the basics of keyboard design. I tried to cover various <em>gotchas</em> that I encountered while creating my Cherry MX component library, so you can avoid these when doing your own or extending mine. Once again, if I missed something important everyone should know, please tell me in the comments.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading through this and see ya in the next post where I&rsquo;ll explain stuff around keyboard schematic.</p>

<p>You know that feel when you&rsquo;re looking for a new keyboard, but nothing seem to suite you well enough? Well, I went through the struggle a while ago and it wasn&rsquo;t easy. Both for me and the people trying to help me.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>My interest in mechanical keyboards started like two years ago (and it&rsquo;s worth noting I still haven&rsquo;t tried any), but I kept telling myself that it&rsquo;s not necessary, that it&rsquo;s not a thing I <em>really</em> need. However things change and so did my view on mechanical keyboards and I started looking around a bit. While I don&rsquo;t want to go through everything that brought me to the decision of making my own mechanical keyboard, I think I should say at least something to it.</p>

<p>It was probably Massdrop that got me thinking about buying mechanical keyboard, but it just wasn&rsquo;t viable to buy anything from Massdrop due to EU import taxes. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what exactly do I want at that time, but at least I knew what&rsquo;s kind of possible to buy and how much does it cost. It all started getting more realistic when I got invited to the MechKeys UK Discord server.</p>

<p>As a programmer I have to navigate through a lot of code and use command-line environments where F-keys are necessary, that&rsquo;s why I decided on a 75% keyboard layout. But what keyboard should I buy? I wanted something hotswappable because I wanted clicky switches for typing, but linear for gaming. Really though combination for premade keyboard, so only DIY kits became an option.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-deal">The real deal</h2>

<p>The first thing that seemed like what I was looking for was the MechBoards UK <a href="https://mechboards.co.uk/shop/all/75-diy-kit/">75% kit</a> (basically KBD75) which looked good and all, but I just wasn&rsquo;t ready to pay that much for a keyboard, even though it included switches and has really nice CNC aluminium case. I also started panicking a bit when I realized that keycaps aren&rsquo;t going to be cheap as well.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xOlButU.jpg" alt="KBD75 - The holy layout" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <p>
        KBD75 - The holy layout
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t giving up yet. As the community dragged me in I knew it has to be something special, something I really want. So I started thinking about doing everything myself as I could get some stuff cheaper. I contacted a few friends about getting CNC milled case and laser-cut plate and it all seemed okay.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>My initial plan was getting open source 75% PCB design manufactured in China and only getting the case designed by a friend, but this failed when I found out there&rsquo;s not a single open source 75% PCB design available. But that couldn&rsquo;t stop me now, it was too late.</p>

<p>To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t expect there&rsquo;s no open source 75% as it&rsquo;s really popular layout among the community, at least from what I&rsquo;ve seen. Despite having only a brief experience with PCB design I decided to contribute to this awesome community with fully open source 75% keyboard design. And that&rsquo;s how <strong>Zireael</strong> was born&hellip;</p>

<p>My current goals are:</p>

<ul>
<li>KBD75 layouts support minimum</li>
<li>QMK firmware support</li>
<li>PCB with mostly SMD components including controller</li>
<li>Switch backlight only (RGB strip in next revision)</li>
<li>Wrist rest CAD files :)</li>
<li>You suggest&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-now">What now</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see how naive was I thinking I can do it without any previous experience with mechs, however the fact it&rsquo;s being done for the community is pushing me forward. I somehow managed to overcome every obstacle till now thanks to the huge help and guidance I have from the guys over at the MechKeys UK Discord and friends who guided me through the PCB design till now.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s it. You&rsquo;re welcome to stay for more news about this and if there&rsquo;s anything you&rsquo;d like to see on this keyboard just tell me in the comments and I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.</p>

<p>While previous two articles were rather explanatory, next time I&rsquo;d like to dive a bit more into the design process itself.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure if I can give you proper introduction, but I can at least try. This blog&rsquo;s main purpose, is getting feedback from you on my projects, so I can make them better and eventually attractive for others. I&rsquo;d also like to keep anyone who likes my stuff informed about the latest progress and maybe even share a few tips that might help. Please, leave me a message if you have an interesting topic I should write about.</p>

<h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>

<p>My name&rsquo;s Albert Moravec and I&rsquo;m a programmer from the Czech republic with a lot of interests&hellip; I&rsquo;ll eventually reveal them to you, but all you need to know for now is that I&rsquo;m into programming, electronics and DIY in general.</p>

<p>I also recently got into this mechanical keyboards thing and I thought it might be a good idea to publish my work somewhere, so others can use it. If you want to contact me, feel free to send me a message on Discord - Albru#5814</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-need-from-you">What do I need from you?</h2>

<p>I <em>need</em> your feedback because I&rsquo;m really bad at deciding stuff, I want to hear your thoughts on my projects and I want to know if it&rsquo;s good enough for others. As I&rsquo;ll be documenting open source and community projects here, it is really important for me to know what should I do better and what do you expect from my projects. <em>Any</em> kind of feedback is heavily appreciated!</p>

      <description>This post is gonna be a little flashback for me, as I started working on this project before I created this blog, so if I miss anything you&amp;rsquo;d like to know, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to tell me in the comments. It should serve more as a build log where I can release assets I created to the public and maybe help a few people with creating their own components, not necessarily for Eagle.</description>

      <description>You know that feel when you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a new keyboard, but nothing seem to suite you well enough? Well, I went through the struggle a while ago and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. Both for me and the people trying to help me.
Motivation My interest in mechanical keyboards started like two years ago (and it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting I still haven&amp;rsquo;t tried any), but I kept telling myself that it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary, that it&amp;rsquo;s not a thing I really need.</description>

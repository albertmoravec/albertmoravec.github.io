      <description>You know that feel when you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a new keyboard, but nothing seem to suite you well enough? Well, I went through the struggle a while ago and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. Both for me and the people trying to help me.
Motivation My interest in mechanical keyboards started like two years ago (and it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting I still haven&amp;rsquo;t tried any), but I kept telling myself that it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary, that it&amp;rsquo;s not a thing I really need.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure if I can give you proper introduction, but I can at least try. This blog&amp;rsquo;s main purpose, is getting feedback from you on my projects, so I can make them better and eventually attractive for others. I&amp;rsquo;d also like to keep anyone who likes my stuff informed about the latest progress and maybe even share a few tips that might help. Please, leave me a message if you have an interesting topic I should write about.</description>

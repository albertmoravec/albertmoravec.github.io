<p>You know that feel when you&rsquo;re looking for a new keyboard, but nothing seem to suite you well enough? Well, I went through the struggle a while ago and it wasn&rsquo;t easy. Both for me and the people trying to help me.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>My interest in mechanical keyboards started like two years ago (and it&rsquo;s worth noting I still haven&rsquo;t tried any), but I kept telling myself that it&rsquo;s not necessary, that it&rsquo;s not a thing I <em>really</em> need. However things change and so did my view on mechanical keyboards and I started looking around a bit. While I don&rsquo;t want to go through everything that brought me to the decision of making my own mechanical keyboard, I think I should say at least something to it.</p>

<p>It was probably Massdrop that got me thinking about buying mechanical keyboard, but it just wasn&rsquo;t viable to buy anything from Massdrop due to EU import taxes. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what exactly do I want at that time, but at least I knew what&rsquo;s kind of possible to buy and how much does it cost. It all started getting more realistic when I got invited to the MechKeys UK Discord server.</p>

<p>As a programmer I have to navigate through a lot of code and use command-line environments where F-keys are necessary, that&rsquo;s why I decided on a 75% keyboard layout. But what keyboard should I buy? I wanted something hotswappable because I wanted clicky switches for typing, but linear for gaming. Really though combination for premade keyboard, so only DIY kits became an option.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-deal">The real deal</h2>

<p>The first thing that seemed like what I was looking for was the MechBoards UK <a href="https://mechboards.co.uk/shop/all/75-diy-kit/">75% kit</a> (basically KBD75) which looked good and all, but I just wasn&rsquo;t ready to pay that much for a keyboard, even though it included switches and has really nice CNC aluminium case. I also started panicking a bit when I realized that keycaps aren&rsquo;t going to be cheap as well.</p>

<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t giving up yet. As the community dragged me in I knew it has to be something special, something I really want. So I started thinking about doing everything myself as I could get some stuff cheaper. I contacted a few friends about getting CNC milled case and laser-cut plate and it all seemed okay.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>My initial plan was getting open source 75% PCB design manufactured in China and only getting the case designed by a friend, but this failed when I found out there&rsquo;s not a single open source 75% PCB design available. But that couldn&rsquo;t stop me now, it was too late.</p>

<p>To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t expect there&rsquo;s no open source 75% as it&rsquo;s really popular layout among the community, at least from what I&rsquo;ve seen. Despite having only a brief experience with PCB design I decided to contribute to this awesome community with fully open source 75% keyboard design. And that&rsquo;s how <strong>Zireael</strong> was born&hellip;</p>

<p>My current goals are:</p>

<ul>
<li>KBD75 layouts support minimum</li>
<li>QMK firmware support</li>
<li>PCB with mostly SMD components including controller</li>
<li>Switch backlight only (RGB strip in next revision)</li>
<li>Wrist rest CAD files :)</li>
<li>You suggest&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-now">What now</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see how naive was I thinking I can do it without any previous experience with mechs, however the fact it&rsquo;s being done for the community is pushing me forward. I somehow managed to overcome every obstacle till now thanks to the huge help and guidance I have from the guys over at the MechKeys UK Discord and friends who guided me through the PCB design till now.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s it. You&rsquo;re welcome to stay for more news about this and if there&rsquo;s anything you&rsquo;d like to see on this keyboard just tell me in the comments and I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.</p>

<p>While previous two articles were rather explanatory, next time I&rsquo;d like to dive a bit more into the design process itself.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is gonna be a little flashback for me, as I started working on this project before I created this blog, so if I miss anything you&amp;rsquo;d like to know, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to tell me in the comments. It should serve more as a build log where I can release assets I created to the public and maybe help a few people with creating their own components, not necessarily for Eagle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You know that feel when you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a new keyboard, but nothing seem to suite you well enough? Well, I went through the struggle a while ago and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. Both for me and the people trying to help me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My interest in mechanical keyboards started like two years ago (and it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting I still haven&amp;rsquo;t tried any), but I kept telling myself that it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary, that it&amp;rsquo;s not a thing I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need. However things change and so did my view on mechanical keyboards and I started looking around a bit. While I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go through everything that brought me to the decision of making my own mechanical keyboard, I think I should say at least something to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

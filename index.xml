      <description>You know that feel when you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a new keyboard, but nothing seem to suite you well enough? Well, I went through the struggle a while ago and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. Both for me and the people trying to help me.
Motivation My interest in mechanical keyboards started like two years ago (and it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting I still haven&amp;rsquo;t tried any), but I kept telling myself that it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary, that it&amp;rsquo;s not a thing I really need.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve come to a place full of terrible code and mechanical keyboards obsession and I&amp;rsquo;m going to give you more of these for sure. My plan is using this blog to log progress of my coding experiments, custom mechanical keyboard projects and who knows, maybe even more in the future.
In the nearest future I&amp;rsquo;m going to publish progress of creating my home-made 75% keyboard.
Who am I? My name&amp;rsquo;s Albert Moravec and I&amp;rsquo;m a programmer from the Czech republic with a lot of interests&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll eventually reveal them to you, but all you need to know for now is that I&amp;rsquo;m into programming, electronics and DIY.</description>
